    <title>Suryansh is the best</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    So the title of the page helps to search the page using the browser, so if the title is "Suryansh is the best" and you search that on google then there are high chances that this page will show up. 

    Then for the meta tags they are basically used to tell the browser how to display the page. The charset is used to tell the browser that the page is in UTF-8 format. The viewport is used to tell the browser how to display the page on different devices.

    So the title and meta tags are very important for the SEO of the page.

    html lang is used to tell the browser that the page is in english language.

    and this contributes to the structure of the page.
